# Sitruuna Theme for Sublime

A beautiful dark theme based on the [Sitruuna Vim theme](https://github.com/eemed/sitruuna.vim) . Since no sublime version of the theme existed, I decided to write my own referring to the original vim theme. It's pretty close to the original but improvements and feedbacks are welcome.

Following is the screenshot of this plugin in action. A Jetbrains port of theme is also in progress since that's my IDE of choice and I would love to use same theme everywhere.

- Colorscheme: Sitruuna
- Font: Victor Mono
